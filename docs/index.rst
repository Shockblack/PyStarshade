PyStarshade documentation
=========================

`PyStarshade` is a tool for simulating high-contrast imaging of exoplanets with starshades. 

What is a starshade? A starshade is a shaped mask flown in formation with a telescope to block starlight and image faint exoplanets.

Complex electric fields are propagated at three planes (starshade, telescope aperture and focal plane) using Fresnel or Fraunhofer diffraction, computed with Bluesteins FFT. `PyStarshade` allows for simulating imaging for a discretized exoplanetary scene of flux, varying starshade mask and telescope aperture mask (interfacing with HCIPy to generate mission telescope apertures).
